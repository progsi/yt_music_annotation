    "Please use this notebook for music similarity annotation of retrieved versions from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). Our goal is to annotate as many pairs of YouTube videos as possible. **A** should represent a work or song, while **B** represents a candidate video which we crawled from YouTube. We want to find out whether **B** is really a musical version of **A**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please annotate by conducting the following steps:\n",
    "1. Execute the code cell below, this will show you a prompt with two embedded audios from YouTube\n",
    "2. Listen to audio **A** by clicking on it. You do not need to listen to the full recording, but should try to figure out which song it is (if you know it) or try to remember some important part(s) about it (e.g. chorus).\n",
    "3. Listen to **B** and do the same like you did for **A**. Try to figure out whether **B** is a musical version of **A**.\n",
    "4. Select based on your decision:\n",
    "    - `b_matches_a`: **B** is the piece as **A** (e.g same studio recording but YouTube uploader and quality might be different)\n",
    "    - `b_version_a`: **B** is in fact a musical version of **A** but has some major changes (e.g. tempo, genre, instrumentation, changes in structure, harmony, melody)\n",
    "    - `b_unrelated_a`: **B** is originating from a different song than **A**.\n",
    "    - `b_nonmusic`: **B** does not contain music but noise only (e.g. speech, nature sounds, traffic sounds). \n",
    "    - `unsure`: You are uncertain about the relationship between the two recordings. You can use this option also in case you notice a bug (e.g. **A** is not a musical piece or one of the recordings is not available on YouTube)\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can find some examples of relationships below the code cell.\n",
